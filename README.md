# NewspaperArticleClassification
A 20_newspaper database was used to train this model which contained over 20,000 newspaper articles of different categories.

In this project, I compared the accuracy of hand-coded multinomial bayes theorem with multinomial naive bayes classifier from sckikit-learn.

One of the most challenging part was to loop through 20,000 files which were distributed over 20 folders. I used OS module for that, honestly one of the most creative solutions to the problem that I have ever encountered in my coding journey. I would really like it if you could go through the solution. 

I have used 2 nested loops, followed by extracting useful data from files, cleaning it up and doing NLP was also very challenging especially since I decided to write every function from scratch.
